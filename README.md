# jenkins-docker
Integrate jenkins with docker for Ubuntu 20.04 (AWS EC2)

A seamless Jenkins and Docker integration to include in your pipeline, for a faster setup.

This setup allows the communication between our jenkins container and the dockerclient/socket running on the host machine (EC2) - the purpose is to allow Jenkins start new containers on the host.
